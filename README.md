Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is essential to being successful in software development. You never know what kind of updates or modifications might be needed in the future, so creating basic modules that you can manipulate in each specific instance is crucial. For example, the CRUD module in Python for this project is incredibly simple by design. For this project, the read function was needed to read and search the database for matching queries. By hardcoding the filters into the dashboard code instead of the CRUD module, the module can be reused in future projects without modification.

I approach problems by first reading, and rereading, the requirements laid out in the documentation, so ensure that I have a good understanding of what is needed. I then implement the reuirements one at a time from start to finish, to ensure that they are working. Most of which is done through trial and error, with a little bit of research. I will most definitely look back on this project for future reference, as I am pretty pleased with this work.

This type of project could be beneficial to most companies. The database for this project was huge, and this program was able to successfully filter results that matched exactly what the user was looking for. The opportunities to deploy programs similar to this are endless.
